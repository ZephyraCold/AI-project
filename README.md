# EasyGrade

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

EasyGrade is software for generating random tests and automatic grading. EasyGrade test generator will have an option for generating random tests where the user will be able to choose field, difficulty and length of the test. Teacher will add students and generate a random test for each of them.




## Background

These are just a few most obvious problems that my idea solve:

* problem of cheating on tests
* saves time for both making and grading tests
* ecological perspective - no more printing, all the solved tests will be saved in the individual student's account
* students will have the opportunity to practise and prepare for the exam  


Problem of cheating is very common among the students, this way all of them will have different problems to solve so at least they want copy answers from one another. Making tests are also extremely time consuming for the teacher and this way the could have more time for lesson planning.
My personal motivation is that I'm also a teacher and it's very challenging to test students' knowledge online during the pandemic. My topic is interesting because children and their education are one of the most important challenges in the world


## How is it used?

The teacher and students will make their accounts (student and teacher account). The teacher will then add her students inside the group and select the date and time of the test, field that will be tested (for example - Physics -> Dynamics -> Work, energy and power -> choose students or group -> generate random tests), difficulty and time. This software would be great for online classes, but also for the use inside a class.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data is coming from the database for the assignments, and later the data will be collected upon completing tests and generate statistics about particular problems that students solve well, or not well. From this information teacher can modify their lessons and focus on things that are students struggling with.



## What next?

The next step would be that students upload their written solutions to the software (currently there would be multiple choice answers), and using NLP AI grades their solutions like a teacher
