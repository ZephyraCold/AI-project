# EasyGrade

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

EasyGrade is software for generating random tests and automatic grading. EasyGrade test generator will have an option for genereting random tests where the user will be able to choose fileld, difficulty and length of the test. Teacher will add students and generate a random test for each of them.




## Background

These are just a few most obvious problems that my idea solve:

* problem of cheating on tests
* saves time for both making and grading tests
* ecological perspective - no more printing, all the solved tests wil be saved at individual students account
* students will have the oportunity to practise and prepare for the exam  

Problem of cheating is very common among the students, this way all of them will have diffrent problems to solve so at least they want copy answers from one another. Making tests is also extremly time consuming for the teacher and this way the could have more time for lesson planing.
My personal motivation is that I'm also a theacher and its very challenging to test students knowledge online during the pandemic. My topic is intresting because children and their education is one of the most important challenge in the world


## How is it used?

The teacher and students will make their accounts (student and techer account). The techer will then add her students inside the group and select date and time of the test, field that will be tested (for example - Physics -> Dynamics -> Work, energy and power -> choose students or group -> generate random tests), difficulty and time. This software would be great for online classes but also for the use inside a class.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data is coming from the database for the assigments, and later the data will be collected upon completed tests and generate statistics about particular problems that students solve well, or not well. From this information teacher can modify their lessons and focus on things that are students strugling with.



## What next?

Next step would be that students upload their written solutions to the software (currently there would be multiple choice answers), and using NLP AI grades their solutions like a techer
